## BB Media Data Hub

The **BB Media Data Hub** repository is your central resource for accessing YML schemas and a valuable wiki with detailed information about services on our S3. Here you will find everything you need to work efficiently with media data.

### Available Schemas

In our repository, we offer schemas for a wide range of products and services, including:

- Audiovisual Identifiers & Metadata
- Awards
- Content Tracker & Coming Soon
- Distributor
- Hits
- Livestreaming & Fast Channels
- Prices, Plans & Bundles
- Streaming Availability & Content Pulse
- Top Ten

### Tools and resources

To facilitate access and manipulation of data, we recommend using the following tools:

- **Pandas**: A powerful Python package for data manipulation. Perfect for working with complex data structures.
- **AWS CLI**: A command line tool for interacting with AWS services, including S3.
- **Boto3**: The Python library for AWS, which allows writing software that uses services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

You can install these tools by following the installation links:
- [Install Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
- [Install AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Install Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html)

Additionally, data can be accessed in S3 using graphical user interfaces (GUI) that allow connection to Amazon S3.

### Access to the demonstration

To obtain a full demonstration of our capabilities, you must request an access key. This will allow you to thoroughly explore how our schemas and tools can benefit your projects.
